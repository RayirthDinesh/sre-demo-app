"""FastAPI webhook server for the Self-Healing SRE Agent.

GitHub Actions calls this server after every CI run on a watched branch.
On a "failure" payload this is where the agent pipeline would kick off
(diagnose -> write fix -> test in sandbox -> open PR). For now it validates
the request, authenticates it, and logs it cleanly.

Run locally:   python main.py
Health check:  curl http://localhost:8000/health
